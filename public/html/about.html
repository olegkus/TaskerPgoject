<span>Before filling out this form, you should take some sensible precautions. We want to keep you safe and ensure that your contact
    with SIS is secure. Internet traffic is monitored by most governments. It is also possible, in some circumstances, for
    specialists to retrieve internet traffic from a device that you have used. To use this site safely, you should be confident
    in using the internet in a secure way and have a good understanding of the vulnerabilities of the device and internet
    connection you are using. We recommend you consider the following steps: Do not contact us from a computer or connection
    that can be linked to you or people that you know. Do use a new, disposable device or public computer (perhaps in a library
    or internet café – although in many counties these are closely monitored). If possible, do not contact us from inside
    your own country, or from a country likely to share security information with your country. Be aware of security cameras
    and other techniques that may allow other to see your screen. Create a new email account (for example Gmail, Outlook
    or GMX) for us to reply to and only check this account on a computer and connection not linked to you. Do not use a name,
    phone number or other details linked to you when creating this account. Consider additional precautions such as hiding
    your internet activity using commercial options. Commercial internet security is a fast changing field and you need to
    be sure any method you use is secure and does not attract attention. If you are unsure about any of the above, or believe
    that your contact with SIS through the internet could be intercepted and therefore cause you difficulties, please consider
    other options such as visiting a British Embassy in person, ideally in a country which has friendly relations with the
    UK. Threats to the United Kingdom The UK continues to face a growing number of global threats and challenges. SIS (MI6)
    mission includes gathering intelligence to counteract these threats. If you have any information that can help our mission
    then please use our secure contact us form. If you have information relating to immediate threats to the UK, such as
    terrorism, please pass this immediately to the Security Service. If you are living within the UK and you have information
    that relates to an imminent threat to life or property, please contact the police on 999 or the police Anti-Terrorist
    Hotline on 0800 789 321. Note: Please do not use this ' + "'contact us'" + ' form to submit careers enquiries as we are
    unable to respond to careers enquiries submitted via this route. If you are interested in applying for a career in SIS
    please visit our careers pages. Members of the public who wish to contact SIS with a general enquiry may do so via PO
    Box 1300, London SE1 1BD. If you have information that you think will be of interest to us.</span>
